Detection phaseâ€¨
Humans
1. Detect humans - Stationary or moving
2. Differentiate humans standing on pavements and those not.
3. Be able to predict basic path of human to avoid collision
4. Should be able to detect humans from different sides of the road
5. If they are halting for too much time in one location?
6. 




Other vehicles
1. Detect stationery or moving vehicles
2. Dimensions of vehicles
3. Speed of vehicles (turning approximations)
4. Probable path for approaching vehicle
5. Maybe - ambulance 
6. Types - automobiles, 2 wheelers, big trucks, tractor, cycles, campus bus
7. Even if vehicles are coming on the wrong side detect and halt.
8. On narrow roads(One way) how do we deal with it?




Animals
HIGHLY IMPROBABLE PATH
1. Ariels - birds
2. Mid size - dogs/ pigs
3. Small - cats and the 
4. Also recognise cattle. 
5. Maybe monkeys


Trees
1. Trees/ plants obstructing certain roads
2. Big branches fallen over
3. Creepers
4. 


Whether conditions

1. LIGHT SOURCE -Campus is very dimly lit in certain areas. How do we deal with it? (Thermal imaging/ Sonar/ LiDAR)
2. Fog
3. Rain
4. Slippery roads
5. Sand/ material of road



Barricades/Objects
1. Dustbins
2. Stones/ rocks
3. Gates
4. 



Path
1. Pavement or not
2. Stay on correct side of road(use road line markings)
3. Speed brakes
4. Terrain (Slopes). How to brake and Start on slopes
5. Pedestrian crossings
6. Identify road signs
7. Determine the width of road, radius of turns, Calculate if vehicle can fir in the given path
